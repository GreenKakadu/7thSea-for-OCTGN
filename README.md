7th Sea CCG plugin for OCTGN
============================

7th Sea finally sails into OCTGN. A card game about swashbuckling pirates, ruthless privateers and even undead horrors from Davy Jones' locker.

This is a repository for the a game definition for the [Online Card and Tabletop Gaming Network (OCTGN)](http://octgn.net).

* Automation Rank: **D** *(This game definition contains no automation.)*


Available Sets
---------

Currently 7th Sea does not utilize OCTGN auto-generated proxies to play. You'll need to download the card image packs to be able to play. 

The link below will provide you with a download bundle you can import into OCTGN by the "add o8c" function in the game manager

* [7th Sea Card CCG Images Bundle](http://dbzer0.com/pub/7thSea/sets/7thSea-Sets-Bundle.o8c) *(Last Updated 14/04/2013)*

A lot of images in this bundle are built manually off of templates. In the future I hope I'll be adding proper high quality scans as they are procured and will provide a download link here.


Linkage

Unfortunately there's not much of a community remaining around the 7th Sea CCG. The best I can find is the [Gone but not Forgotten](http://www.alderac.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=264) forum of AEG and then your second best option to find other people interested in the game is the [Board Game Geek page](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3125/7th-sea-collectible-card-game). Hopefully, now that the game is playable on OCTGN, we might be able to rejuvenate the community. So please **do** speak up if you're around ;)
