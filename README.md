7th Sea CCG plugin for OCTGN
============================

7th Sea finally sails into OCTGN. A card game about swashbuckling pirates, ruthless privateers and even undead horrors from Davy Jones' locker.

**Note:** The files in this repository are just the game engine, you'll also need to download [the sets](http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=24). If this is the first time downloading a game for OCTGN, you should check out [the step-by-step instructions](http://dbzer0.com/blog/7th-sea-ccg-on-octgn).

Unfortunately there's not much of a community remaining around the 7th Sea CCG. The best I can find is the [Gone but not Forgotten](http://www.alderac.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=264) forum of AEG and then your second best option to find other people interested in the game is the [Board Game Geek page](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3125/7th-sea-collectible-card-game). Hopefully, now that the game is playable on OCTGN, we might be able to rejuvenate the community. So please **do** speak up if you're around ;)

Changelog
--------

### 1.0.1

* Small change in the deck's sections. The first section is now called "Ship, Captain & Starting Crew" to better signify what you're supposed to put there. 
  The above change means that you'll have to modify your decks. To avoid manually searching your cards to put back ship and captain, simply edit your decks with a text editor and replace "Ship &amp;amp; Captain" with "Ship, Captain &amp;amp; Starting Crew"

### 1.0.0

* Made compatible with OCTGN 3.0.1.0 onwards. Users will have to redownload the markers and all sets.

### 0.1.2

This is the very basic first version of the engine. Don't expect much advanced functionality for now but it should be playable, albeit fairly manual.

* Added a basic Game Setup script. Will place the 5 seas vertically (if they don't exist already) and place your ship and captain on the left/right.
