7th Sea CCG plugin for OCTGN
============================

7th Sea finally sails into OCTGN. A card game about swashbuckling pirates, ruthless privateers and even undead horrors from Davy Jones' locker.

**Note:** The files in this repository are just the game engine, you'll also need to download [the sets](http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=24). If this is the first time downloading a game for OCTGN, you should check out [the step-by-step instructions](http://dbzer0.com/blog/7th-sea-ccg-on-octgn).

Linkage
-------

Unfortunately there's not much of a community remaining around the 7th Sea CCG. The best I can find is the [Gone but not Forgotten](http://www.alderac.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=264) forum of AEG and then your second best option to find other people interested in the game is the [Board Game Geek page](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3125/7th-sea-collectible-card-game). Hopefully, now that the game is playable on OCTGN, we might be able to rejuvenate the community. So please **do** speak up if you're around ;)

Changelog
--------

### 0.1.2

This is the very basic first version of the engine. Don't expect much advanced functionality for now but it should be playable, albeit fairly manual.

* Added a basic Game Setup script. Will place the 5 seas vertically (if they don't exist already) and place your ship and captain on the left/right.
