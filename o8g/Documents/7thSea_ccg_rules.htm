<P class="p0 ft0">7th Sea CCG</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">Introduction</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">7th Sea is a game of high seas swashbuckling and <NOBR>ship-to-ship</NOBR> combat. In 7th Sea, you are the captain of a ship fighting for control of the seas of Théah. Whether you want to board your opponentsandfightwithswords,blastthemwithyourcannons, or simply ram them to the bottom of the sea, you will organize your crew and adventure across the seas until the time is right to strike.</P>
<P class="p3 ft2">7th Sea is a Collectible Card Game, which means that there are hundreds of cards available for you to play with. If you have a starter deck, you have 60 of those cards right now. As you play you will discover that part of the fun of a collectible card game is tracking down the ones that work best for you. When the game was in print, you could expect to see new cards for 7th Sea every 3 to 4 months as the nations of Théah fight for control of the seas.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">7th Sea was both in decks (that also held rulebooks or rulesheets) and packs. There was a deck for each faction in the game which included a Captain, a Ship, and one special card for that nation. The packs were not <NOBR>nation-specific.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p5 ft1">The Object</P>
<P class="p6 ft3"><NOBR>Theobjectofthegamein7thSeaisverysimple–eithertocontrol</NOBR> the seas, or to be the last Captain sailing the seas of Théah. You win the game when all the other Captains have been sunk, or if you are the only player to have a Control Sea Attachment card in each of the five seas at the end of the turn. You can play with any number of players as long as you have at least two.</P>
<P class="p7 ft1">The Deck</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">The cards in a starter deck were perfectly good to use in your first games, but eventually you will want to pick other cards for your deck that work well together. When you are designing a deck, you need to have at least sixty cards in the deck. This includes your Captain, Ship, and starting Crew. Also, you may not have more than three copies of any card in your deck.</P>
<P class="p7 ft1">The Golden Rule</P>
<P class="p6 ft4">7thSeahasmanydifferentcardswhichcandosomewildthings. Whenever one of the cards specifically contradicts a rule in the rulebook, the cards takes precedence over the rulebook.</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">Tacking Cards</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">Many times when you are using a card’s abilities or producing points in a skill, you must “tack” the card. To do so, turn the card sideways 90 to show that it’s been used. Cards untack at theendoftheturnorthroughspecialcardeffects.To“untack”a card, you turn it back to its original <NOBR>straight-up</NOBR> position to show that it’s ready to act.</P>
<P class="p8 ft4">Cards enter play untacked and ready to be used. Tacking a card does not tack its Attachments. Tacked cards can still perform actions that do not require them to tack.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id_2">
<P class="p9 ft1">Game <NOBR>Set-Up</NOBR></P>
<P class="p10 ft2">At the beginning of the game, each player starts with a deck of at least 60 cards. Arrange a set of the five Sea Cards between the players in the following order: Trade Sea, Frothing Sea, La Boca, Forbidden Sea, and The Mirror (the seas do not count against any player’s deck limits). Simultaneously, the players reveal which one Captain and Ship they will be using (these come from your deck and count toward your 60 cards). After the players have seen what the other players’ Captain and Ship are, they decide on their starting Crew and remove them from their decks, revealing them simultaneously. The starting Crew’s total Influence cost can’t be greater than the Captain’s starting Wealth, the number of Crew may not exceed the Ship’s Crew maximum, and the Crew must be either unaligned or of the same faction as your Captain. An effect that prevents you from hiring a specific Crew also prevents you using that Crew in your starting Crew.</P>
<P class="p11 ft3">After all of the Crews have been revealed, each player places <NOBR>atokenintheirCaptain’shomeSeatorepresenttheirShip–your</NOBR> Captain tells you which Sea your Ship will start in. Then, each player shuffles the cards remaining in their deck. After allowing opponents a chance to cut, each player draws seven cards to form their starting hand.</P>
<P class="p7 ft1">Types of Cards</P>
<P class="p12 ft5">The next few sections show each card type with a description of the things you will find on that card.</P>
<P class="p13 ft1">Crew</P>
<P class="p14 ft2">Crew cards are the most basic card in the game. Each Crew card represents one or more people on your Ship that will fire cannons, swing from the mainsail, or cast a spell.</P>
<P class="p15 ft4">At the top of the card is the Crew’s name. To its left is the Crew’s cost. The cost is how much Influence is needed to hire that Crew for your Ship either before or during the game. Hiring</P>

<P class="p2 ft2">Crewwillbeexplainedlaterintherulebook.Belowthecostisthe Crew’s Faction symbol, showing what faction they are aligned to. On the other side of the card there may be other symbols, which are provided for flavor and have no game effect.</P>
<P class="p31 ft2">Right below the artwork are flags with the five skills. From left to right they are: Cannon, Sailing, Adventuring, Influence, and Swashbuckling. Whenever you need points in those skills (to bring a card into play, or perhaps to cancel an opponent’s action), you may tack members of your Crew to generate a number of points equal to their skill rating.</P>
<P class="p32 ft23">Below the Skill Flags is the text area. The text box tells you more about the Crew, including any special effects they may have on play. At the top of the text box, there may be some bold- faced “traits.” Most traits don’t cause effect directly. Instead, they make the Crew eligible for certain card effects, since some cards can only be played on a Crew that has a specific trait.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2">For example, you can only play the card “I Told You Not to Trust Him” on a Crew who has the Villainous trait. Some traits are not a single work, but a phrase. These traits are listed with the card’s abilities, under the boldfaced traits; unlike a trait, an ability always starts with “Act:” or “React:” Finally, at the bottom of the text box there may be text in italics. That text is known as “flavor text” – it has no effect on the game, but tells you how this card fits into the larger story of 7th Sea.</P>
<P class="p4 ft24">Finally, in the bottom left are the Boarding Boxes which will be explained in the “Boarding” section.</P>
<P class="p34 ft1">Captain</P>
<P class="p6 ft25">Your Captain is a special type of Crew card. You begin the game with one Captain in play, and that determines which faction you represent in the game. At the top of the card is your Captain’s name. To the left of the Captain’s name is his or her starting Wealth – this determines how much Influence you have to buy your starting Crew at the beginning of the game. Below the</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id_3">
<P class="p35 ft2">coin is your Captain’s faction symbol, showing where his or her loyalties lie. On the other side of the card there may be other symbols, these are provided to add flavor to the Character.</P>
<P class="p36 ft3">Like the Crew cards, your Captain has a set of Skill flag below the artwork which show his skill ratings. Your Captain can tack to produce skill points just like normal Crew. In fact, your Captain is considered to be a Crew card, and can be affected by cards which say they can affect Crew. However, normal Crew cards are not affected by cards which only affect Captains. In the text box below the skills, the Captain tells you which Sea his Ship starts in. The Captain has a special ability or trait which is tied to whether or not he has enough of his own Crew for the Ship to run smoothly.</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">Ship</P>
<P class="p35 ft2">As it is on the other cards, the name of your Ship is at the top, with the Ship’s faction symbol to the left. A Ship with a faction symbol may only be sailed by a Captain from that faction. A Ship with no faction symbol may be sailed by any Captain. To the right of the name is your Ship’s Move Cost – this is how many Sailing points you must pay to move your Ship.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2">At the bottom of the card is your Ship’s text box. In that text box is the Ship’s Crew Maximum. You may not put another Crew into play if you already have a number of Crew cards (including your Captain) in play equal to or greater than your Crew Maximum. If for some reason the number of Crew on your ship exceeds your Crew Maximum, you do not need to discard any Crew. Finally, in the text box, each Ship has one or more special abilities that it may perform.</P>
<P class="p39 ft26">Many Ships have an ability that reads: “React: Tack before performing an action, to move to an adjacent Sea.” This is referred to as the Ship’s “free move.” Although this move does not cost any Sailing skill points, it can only be done before you perform another action.</P>

<DIV>
<DIV id="id_1">
<P class="p9 ft1">Action</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">Actions are all the things that your Captain and Crew do to send your opponents to the bottom of the sea. Every Action cards has a Card Name and Boarding Boxes just like the Crew cards. The Text box tells you what happens if the Action works.</P>
<P class="p3 ft2">To play the Action card from your hand, you have to play skill points(see“PayingCosts”)equaltoorgreaterthantheAction’s blue Cost Flag.</P>
<P class="p33 ft2">Many Action cards have a copper Cancel Flag. If a card has a Cancel Flag, then the player being targeted with the action can payskillpointsequaltoorgreaterthantheCancelFlagtocancel the action (see “Canceling”).</P>
<P class="p33 ft2">Most actions are played during the Actions Phase of the turn when it is your turn to perform an action. However, some Action cards are labeled “React:”. You are allowed to jump outside of the normal turn order to play these cards. React cards will tell you when you are allowed to play them.</P>
<P class="p40 ft4">Action cards are discarded after they are played. Actions that have continuing effects stay in play until the effect ends. When the effect is over, the action is discarded normally.</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">Attachment</P>
<P class="p6 ft5">Attachments are cards that change the cards in play. An Attachment can be a monster that prowls the sea, a parrot sitting on your Captain’s shoulder, or even extra training for your Crew.</P>
<P class="p33 ft25">You may only play Attachments on cards you control or one of the five Seas. An Attachment may only attach to the type of card listed at the top of the Text Box. For example, a “Crew Attachment” may be attached to any one of your Crew cards (including your Captain). However, a “Montaigne Captain Attachment” may on be attached to your Montaigne Captain. Youmayplayattachmentsoncardsthataretacked.Attachments may not be moved to a new card without a card effect. When an</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id_2">
<P class="p14 ft2">Attachment is attached to another card, it is considered to be an Attachment of that type. Thus, if a card attaches to your Ship (evenifitisnotreferredtoasaShipAttachment)itisconsidered to be a Ship Attachment. An Attachment that refers to itself as a Captain Attachment is also considered a Crew Attachment (since Captains are also considered Crew).</P>
<P class="p41 ft27">To the right of the Attachment’s name is a ‘bonus flag’ – it reminds you what skill bonus the Attachment gives, if any, so that you can slide the Attachment under the card and still see what it does.</P>
<P class="p42 ft28">Like Action cards, Attachments have a Cost Flag showing you what you must pay to put the card into play (see “Paying Costs”).</P>
<P class="p42 ft28">Only the player who put the Attachment into play may use any actions on it.</P>
<P class="p13 ft1">Adventure</P>
<P class="p43 ft28">Your Ship can go on all sorts of adventures. When you successfully complete an Adventure, the Adventure card becomes an Attachment.</P>
<P class="p10 ft2"><NOBR>WhenyouputanAdventureintoplay,lookinthetextbox–at</NOBR> the top is how many Seas away from your Ship you need to put the Adventure (no more, no less). For example, if you are in the Frothing Sea and want to play a “2 Seas Away” Adventure, then youcanonlyputitintheForbiddenSea,becausethereisnoSea that is 2 Seas away in the other direction.</P>
<P class="p44 ft3">When you are in a Sea with one of your uncompleted Adventures, you can try to complete it. Adventures usually take a certain number of Adventuring points to complete; sometimes an Adventure may require you to pay some other cost instead of, or in addition to, Adventuring (like discarding a card from your hand). If you pay the Adventuring cost, then you may attach the Adventure to gain its benefits. You cannot complete your opponents’ Adventures.</P>

<P class="p31 ft3">AdventurescanbeplacedandcompletedinanySea,butmost Adventures are easier to complete if you are in the correct Sea. In the correct Sea, you don’t need to pay as much Adventuring to complete it – the Adventure card will tell you which Sea that is. Some Adventures do not cost as much to complete if you meet some other condition (like having a specific card in play or having a Villainous Captain).</P>
<P class="p7 ft1">Chantey</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">A Sea Chantey (pronounced <NOBR>SHAN-tee)</NOBR> represents the stories, events, and climates in Théah that have an effect on play. At the top of the card is the name of the Chantey. In the middle of the Chantey is the card’s cost and/or its cancel cost, if any. When a Chantey is brought into play, any player may pay its cancel cost.</P>
<P class="p40 ft3">Below the artwork is the text box. Here the Chantey will say what effect is has on play. Most Chanteys have a global effect, meaning that they affect all the players in the game. If a Chantey has an ability printed in the text box, all players are considered to have that ability printed on their Captains while the Chantey remains in play. When a Chantey is removed from play, all effects of the Chantey immediately end. When a new Chantey is brought into play, any other Chantey already in play is sunk and placed in its owner’s sunk pile.</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">Sea</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">There are five Seas in the game. They are laid out before the game in the following order: Trade Sea, Frothing Sea, La Boca, Forbidden Sea, and The Mirror. While the Seas do not have any inherent special abilities, there are cards that work better or work only in a particular Sea. You may use any kind of counter to represent the five Seas as long as each location is easily identifiable as the Sea in question.</P>
<P class="p8 ft4">Alongside the text boxes of the Sea cards is a simple diagram showing where that Sea sits when you lay out the five Seas in order. The Mirror and the Trade Sea are not adjacent.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id_3">
<P class="p9 ft1">Paying Costs</P>
<P class="p35 ft2">Just about anything you want to do during the game will involve paying a cost with one of the five skills on a Crew. You have to pay skill points to hire new Crew, to pay for an Attachment, to play an Action card, to cancel an opponent’s action, and in lots of other cases. The cost to put a card into play is always on a blue flag. If the target is allowed to cancel the card, there will be a ‘cancel cost’ on a copper flag that the target may pay after the card’s cost has been paid (see “Canceling”).</P>
<P class="p36 ft2">Whenyouarepayingacost,youcantackoneormoreofyour Crew that have at least one point in that skill. Each Crew that you tack adds their skill to your total. Each Crew tacked may only produce points in one of their skills. You may also use card effectsinsteadof,orinadditionto,tackingCrewtoproduceskill points to pay for the cost. As soon as you have produced enough skill points, then the effect you are paying for occurs (bringing a card into play, canceling an action, or whatever). You may pay only one cost at a time. If for any reason you do not produce enough skill points to pay the cost, the action is canceled.</P>
<P class="p45 ft27">For example, if you need 4 Sailing points to move your Ship to an adjacent Sea, you could tack two Crew with 2 Sailing each, one Crew with 4 Sailing, or even 4 different Crew that each have 1 Sailing.</P>
<P class="p38 ft3">The cost flags use the same five skill icons as the Crew cards, and also use a sixth icon (see Ship’s Move Cost, below). Any card without a yellow cost flag does not have a cost to put it into play – you simply play it at the appropriate time.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">Ship’s Move Cost</P>
<P class="p46 ft24">A ship’s wheel on a cost flag means that you must pay your Ship’s Move Cost (the number in the same wheel in the upper right corner of your Ship card). The Ship’s Move Cost is always paid in Sailing.</P>

<DIV id="id_1">
<DIV id="id_1_1">
<DIV id="id_1_1_1">
<P class="p31 ft3">For example, if your Ship’s Move Cost is a 3, then you would tack 3 Sailing if a cost flag has the wheel. Some actions cost your Ship’s Move Cost plus extra Sailing, so an action requiring Move Cost +2 would cost you a total of five Sailing.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">Suffering Hits</P>
<P class="p47 ft23">Whenever you are suffering Hits, you must find a way to absorb or reduce all of the Hits. There are three ways to absorb Hits:</P>
<P class="p48 ft31"><SPAN class="ft29">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft30">Tacking your Crew to produce Swashbuckling to absorb Hits;</SPAN></P>
<P class="p49 ft5"><SPAN class="ft31">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft32">Sinking your Crew to produce Swashbuckling to absorb Hits; and 3. Reacts that absorb or reduce Hits. You may perform them in any order.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p50 ft33">First of all, you may tack any of your untacked Crew to produce Swashbuckling (equal to their Swashbuckling skill) to absorb Hits. When you tack a Crew to absorb Hits, that Crew absorbs a number of Hits equal to the amount of Swashbuckling produced by that Crew.</P>
<P class="p50 ft2">Secondly, you may sink a tacked or untacked Crew (putting that Crew card and all of its Attachments into your sunk pile – see“DiscardingandSinking,”below)toproduceSwashbuckling equal to their Swashbuckling skill: this absorbs a number of Hits equal to the Swashbuckling produced. An untacked Crew can both tack and then sink to absorb Hits.</P>
<P class="p8 ft33">Finally, there are some Reacts that you may play that help to absorb Hits. You will find these on Action cards and abilities printed on cards in play. You may also use Reacts that produce Swashbuckling to absorb Hits.</P>
<P class="p33 ft26">If even a single Hit remains, you must keep tacking, sinking, and playing Reacts until you have absorbed all of the Hits that were inflicted on your Ship. If you sink your Captain to absorb a Hit, then your Ship goes to the bottom of the sea – you’ve lost this game.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id_1_1_2">
<P class="p14 ft2">At the start of each turn, all players count up the total Sailing skilloftheirentireCrew,includingtheirCaptain.Theplayerwith the most Sailing goes first, and then the order goes clockwise around the table from that player. If two players ever want to play a React at the same time, the player who goes first during the turn gets to play the first React; then each other player in turn may play one.</P>
<P class="p51 ft3">If there is a tie for most Sailing points, then the players who are tied each cut their decks and reveal the cut card. The player who cut the first card alphabetically goes first (ignoring spaces and punctuation). Player then quickly shuffle their decks.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">II. Actions</P>
<P class="p52 ft33">Startingwiththefirstplayer,eachplayermayperformoneofthe following actions. When all players Pass in a row, the Actions Phase is over and the turn moves on to the Draw Cards Phase. The following actions are not in order, and you may do each of them as many times as you wish (and can pay the costs for) during a turn.</P>

<P class="p9 ft1">Discarding and Sinking</P>
<P class="p6 ft26">You have two piles for used cards, your discard pile and your sunk pile. Action cards that you play are discarded after being used. Crew that sink to absorb Hits are sent to your sunk pile along with their Attachments. When you go through your entire deck, shuffle your discard pile and use it to replenish your deck. Cards in your sunk pile never come out except through special card effects.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">Turn Sequence</P>
<P class="p47 ft27">Each turn, players go through each of the following phases in order. After the last phase of a turn, the players start again with phase one on the next turn.</P>

<DIV id="id_1_2_2">
<P class="p9 ft1">1. Hire Crew</P>
<P class="p52 ft33">If you have a Crew in your hand, you may hire one Crew (only one at a time) as an action. To put the Crew into play, you have to pay the Crew’s Influence cost (the blue flag in the corner). When you pay the Crew’s cost, the Crew is put on your Ship untacked and ready to set sail.</P>
<P class="p15 ft3">A card effect that “brings a Crew into play” is considered to be hiring a Crew without cost. Any effect that prevents you from hiring a Crew will prevent you from bringing a Crew into play. If a card effect brings a Crew into play that you could not normally hire, the Crew is immediately discarded.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">2. Experience a Crew</P>
<P class="p59 ft3">Some Crew have the Experienced trait. There are two ways to bring these cards into play. You may hire the Experienced Crew normally, as mentioned above. You may also experience the Crew as an action. If you already have a Crew in play with the same title, you may replace the Crew in play with the Experienced one in your hand. You do not pay the Influence cost of the Experienced Crew. The Experienced Crew takes on all Attachments attached to the Crew it is replacing, as well as</P>

<P class="p7 ft1">3. Play or Perform an Action</P>
<P class="p6 ft26">YoucanplayanActioncardfromyourhandorperformanaction on a card in play. Cards in play that can perform an action have the word “Act:” in their text box before the action (see “Action Cards” and “Actions and Reacts”).</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">4. Put an Adventure into play</P>
<P class="p6 ft26">As an action, you may put a new Adventure into play. When you put an Adventure in play, look in the text box – at the top is exactly how many Seas away from your Ship you need to put the Adventure (see “Adventures”).</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">5. Put a Chantey into play</P>
<P class="p6 ft26">As an action, you may bring a Chantey into play from your hand. Any Chantey already in play is sunk and the effects of the previous Chantey end (see “Chantey”).</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">6. Complete an Adventure</P>
<P class="p6 ft38">As an action, you may complete an Adventure. Once you’ve moved to the Sea that contains one of your Adventures, you may pay the cost to complete that Adventure (see “Adventures”).</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">7. Play an Attachment</P>
<P class="p47 ft39">If you have an Attachment in your hand, you may bring that card into play as an action, attaching it to whatever it attaches to (see “Attachments”).</P>
<P class="p9 ft1">8. Move your Ship</P>
<P class="p47 ft4">Asanaction,youmaymoveyourShiptooneoftheSeasadjacent to the Sea you are in. You must pay your Ship’s Move Cost in Sailing points to move. Tacked Ships may be moved normally.</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">9. Perform a Cannon Attack</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">If there is another Ship in the same Sea as your, you may fire a cannon at it as an action. You tack one (and only one) of your Crew with at least 1 point of Cannon skill to produce Cannon for a Cannon Attack (you may also play Cannon Reacts to increase the amount of Cannon produced). The target Ship suffers Hits equal to the amount of Cannon produced (see “Suffering Hits” for what your target must do to absorb the Hits).</P>
<P class="p7 ft1">10. Attempt a Boarding</P>
<P class="p6 ft3">IfthereisanotherShipinthesameSeaasyours,youmayattempt to begin a Boarding with that Ship. You must pay Sailing equal to your Ship’s Move Cost to attempt the Boarding as an action. That Ship may pay Sailing equal to its Move Cost to cancel the attempt. If the other Ship doesn’t cancel the Boarding, then</P>

<P class="p60 ft28">you and that player take turns making Boarding Attacks until neither of you wants to make any more Boarding Attacks (see “Boarding”).</P>

<P class="p62 ft28">You may discard one of your Crew in play as an action. You may not discard your Captain.</P>
<P class="p13 ft1">12. Discard an Adventure</P>
<P class="p63 ft28">As an action, you may discard an Adventure you have in play that you have not completed.</P>
<P class="p61 ft1">13. Pass</P>
<P class="p64 ft28">You may declare that you do nothing.</P>
<P class="p13 ft1">Action Timing</P>
<P class="p35 ft2">Thetimingofanactionisasfollows:Firstyoudeclaretheaction, announcing the action that you are going to attempt. Next, you pay for the action, producing the necessary skill points by tacking Crew or using card effects that produce skill points. If a cost cannot be paid once the action has been declared, then the action is canceled. Once the cost is paid, the target of the action has the opportunity to pay the action’s cancel cost if it has one. Finally, if all the costs are paid and the action is not canceled, then you resolve the effects of the action. Once you have declared that you are performing an action, you are considered to have taken an action, even if the action is canceled.</P>
<P class="p65 ft1">III. Draw Cards</P>
<P class="p66 ft26">All players draw three cards and add them to their hands. Discard cards if you are above your maximum hand size.</P>
<P class="p34 ft1">IV. Untack</P>
<P class="p64 ft28">All players untack all of their tacked cards.</P>
<P class="p67 ft1">Boarding</P>
<P class="p35 ft2">If another player’s Ship is in the same Sea as yours, you can attempt to begin a Boarding with that Ship. To attempt a Boarding, you pay Sailing equal to your Ship’s Move Cost. The other player may pay Sailing equal to their Ship’s Move Cost to cancel the Boarding (this is a cancel cost). If the other player does not cancel the attempt, then your Ships have connected, and your Crews begin fighting. For the rest of the Boarding, the player who began the Boarding is called “the attacker” and the other player is “the defender.”</P>
<P class="p68 ft3">Beginning with the attacker, you push forward one of your untacked Crew and play any card from your hand to start performing a Boarding Attack (this doesn’t tack your Crew yet). Ignore everything on the card except for the Boarding boxes in the bottom left corner of the card. The largest box and the word along side it, is the Boarding Attack that your Crew just played (for example, “My Buccaneers Slash you for 2 Hits!”). Your Crew is trying to inflict Hits equal to their Swashbuckling. A Crew is considered to be producing Swashbuckling when</P>

<DIV class="dclr"></DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV id="id_1">
<P class="p69 ft27">inflicting Hits with a Boarding Attack. Thus, Reacts and other effects that produce Swashbuckling may be used to inflict extra Hits with a Boarding Attack.</P>
<P class="p70 ft23">The other player can either absorb these Hits, or send one of their own untacked Crew out to fight against yours (this doesn’t tack the Crew yet). If they choose to take the Hits, then they must suffer the Hits normally (see “Suffering Hits”). If they decide to fight, they push forward one of their own untacked Crew and play a Boarding Attack of their own that has your attack below their own. You can only play a Boarding Attack if it has the opponent’s last Attack in one of the two smaller boxes (the Boarding Defense boxes). So, for example, your opponent could push forward their Powder Monkeys and say “The Powder MonkeysstopyourSlash,andThrustatyoufor1Hit.”Byplaying the Boarding Attack, your opponent has reversed the attack and now you must play a new card or suffer Hits.</P>
<P class="p71 ft23">You and your opponent go back and forth playing Boarding Attack cards from your hand for these two Crew until one of you can’t or won’t play a new Boarding Attack. The Crew that played thefinalBoardingAttackproducesSwashbucklingequaltotheir skill (without tacking) to inflict Hits equal to the Swashbuckling produced; a lot of Crew and Attachments help you do extra Hits whenyouinflictHitswithaBoardingAttack.AtackedCrewmay still produce Swashbuckling to inflict Hits during a Boarding Attack. The losing Crew must absorb as many of the Hits as possible. If you are suffering Hits during a Boarding Attack, then you cannot tack or sink other Crew to absorb the Hits until after the Crew in the Boarding is sunk; you may still use Reacts to absorb or reduce the Hits. Once the fighting Crew has been sunk, you suffer any remaining Hits normally.</P>
<P class="p72 ft2">After all the Hits have been suffered, the two Crew involved in the Boarding Attack are tacked (if they weren’t already). All of the Boarding Attack cards that were played are put in the players’ discard piles in the order in which they were played.</P>
<P class="p73 ft2">Oncetheattacker’sBoardingAttackhasfinished(witheither side inflicting Hits), it is the defender’s turn to start performing a Boarding Attack, pushing a Crew forward and playing a card just like the attacker did.</P>
<P class="p73 ft2">ThereisaslightdifferencebetweenplayingaBoardingAttack and performing a Boarding Attack. You play Boarding Attacks from your hand. You perform a Boarding Attack when you push a Crew forward in a Boarding. There are a number of cards that say: “React: Play instead of performing a Boarding Attack.” These cards are played instead of pushing a Crew forward to startperformingaBoardingAttack,notinsteadofplayingacard from your hand when performing a Boarding Attack.</P>
<P class="p74 ft2">After the defender’s opportunity to start performing a Boarding Attack has resolved, each player draws three cards (remember to discard if you are over your maximum; see “Maximum Hand Size”). Then the attacker begins again with a new opportunity to start performing a Boarding Attack.</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">Instead of starting a Boarding Attack, the attacker and defender may just ‘pass’ and not send someone to attack the other player. If the attack elects to ‘pass’ this way, and his pass</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id_2">
<P class="p14 ft4">is immediately followed by a pass from the defender, then the Boarding ends. Once the Boarding is over, players do not draw three cards; the Boarding simply ends and the turn continues.</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">Duels</P>
<P class="p59 ft3">SomecardscreateaDuelbetweenoneofyourCrewandanother player’s Crew. A Duel is resolved like a Boarding Attack being performed during a Boarding, but any Hits left over after the loser sinks are reduced to zero. Effects that are active during a Boarding are also active during a Duel, and effects that are not active during a Boarding are not active during a Duel. Cards that are used “instead of performing a Boarding Attack” may not be used.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">Canceling</P>
<P class="p59 ft3">Many actions have a ‘cancel cost’ in a copper flag, or in the text of the card. The target of the action can pay the cancel cost immediately after the action cost is paid (and before any other Reacts)topreventalloftheeffectsoftheaction.Coststhatwere paid to play the action remain paid, but the effects of the action do not occur. Once an action is canceled, the acting player’s opportunity to take an action is over and play continues to the next player. If the playing of the action card or the bringing of a cardintoplayiscanceled,thecardisdiscarded.Ifthecompletion of an Adventure is canceled, the Adventure remains in play.</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">Targeting</P>
<P class="p52 ft3">Cards often React to something targeting your cards. An action always targets unless it has a global effect (such as “All Ships are tacked”). Anything that inflicts Hits, such as Hits from a card effect, Boarding Attack or Cannon Attack, is assumed to target the Ship suffering the Hits. If an effect cancels the effects of another card, it is targeting that card. If an effect discards or sinks another card, it is targeting that card.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">Actions and Reacts</P>
<P class="p59 ft33">Actions can come from several places. Playing an Action card, performing an action printed on a card you have in play, or performing any of the actions listed in the Action Phase is an action. Each one of them uses up your ‘turn,’ passing the next action to the player on your left.</P>
<P class="p10 ft2">Playing an Action card that results in a Boarding is different from “Performing,” “Starting” or “Attempting” a Boarding, all of which refer to Action #10: Attempt a Boarding. A card that reacts to “Attempting a Boarding” will not affect an Action card or ability that results in a Boarding. The same is true of Cannon Attacks. When a card refers to “Performing a Cannon Attack,” it is referencing Action #9: Perform a Cannon Attack, not an Action card or ability that produces a Cannon Attack.</P>
<P class="p51 ft4">Reacts are a special kind of action. They do not take place ‘in order’ like normal actions, and do not cost you your opportunity to act. Similarly, they do not qualify as actions for game effects</P>

<P class="p2 ft33">which require an action (such as a Ship’s Free Move; producing a React after a Free Move would not satisfy the requirement to produce an action after the Free Move).</P>
<P class="p33 ft3">Reacts can either be an Action card from your hand or printed on a card you have in play. Unlike normal actions which are played only during the Actions Phase, and only when it’s your turn, Reacts are played whenever they say. Each React has a different time that it is played, and can only be played at that time. If more than one player wants to play a React at the same time, they play them in the order for the turn, playing one React then passing to the left just as in the Actions Phase. If a React and a trait have identical timing for activating, the trait occurs before the React.</P>
<P class="p37 ft1">Maximum Hand Size</P>
<P class="p75 ft3">Normally your maximum hand size is seven cards, although there are cards that can increase or decrease you maximum. If you ever have more cards than you maximum in your hand, you must immediately discard cards down to the maximum.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">Experienced Crew</P>
<P class="p76 ft28">Some Crew have the “Experienced” trait. There are two ways to bring these cards into play:</P>
<P class="p77 ft33"><SPAN class="ft31">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft40">You may hire the Experienced Crew normally, unless you already have a Unique Crew in play with the same title (see “Hiring Crew”). It is possible to have three </SPAN><NOBR>non-Unique</NOBR> versions of a Crew and an Experienced version in play at the same time.</P>
<P class="p78 ft26"><SPAN class="ft31">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">If you have a Crew in play with the same title, you may experience that Crew (see “Experience a Crew”).</SPAN></P>
<P class="p34 ft1">Loyal</P>
<P class="p79 ft24">A Crew with the “Loyal” trait will only work for a Captain from the same faction. You may not start or put into play a Loyal Crew from another Faction.</P>
<P class="p34 ft1">Unique</P>
<P class="p47 ft3">If a card has the “Unique” trait, then there is only one of that person or item in Théah. You cannot put a unique card into play if you already have a copy of that card in play. It’s okay if another player already has one in play, however. You are not limited to having only one in your deck.</P>
<P class="p34 ft1">Knacks</P>
<P class="p47 ft25">Some Attachment and Action cards have the “Knack” trait. A card may refer to itself as a Topman Knack, a Swordsman Knack or a Fear 1 Knack. All this means is that you must attach the Knack to a Crew with the same trait or preceding requirement (e.g. – Adventuring 1 Knack). Thus a Topman Knack may only be attached to a Crew with the Topman trait. Knacks listed with a number mean that the Crew attaching or using the knack (in regards to Action cards) must have a value equal to or greater than the knack’s requirement (e.g. – an Adventuring 1 Knack may only be attached to a Crew with an Adventuring skill of 1</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id_3">
<P class="p35 ft24">or more). Swordsman Knacks have their own special rule: A Swordsman may not have more Swordsman Knacks attached than his Swordsman Bonus.</P>
<P class="p34 ft1">Glossary</P>
<P class="p80 ft33"><SPAN class="ft42">Ability – </SPAN>Text on a card in play which is preceded with an “Act:” or “React:”. Text on a card in play which is not preceded with an “Act” or “React:” is considered a trait.</P>
<P class="p38 ft33"><SPAN class="ft42">Action – </SPAN>One of the 13 activities listed under the Action Phase Heading that players may perform during a turn.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft43">Alphabetical – </SPAN>When determining which card title come first alphabetically, all words are used (even small words), spaces are ignored, and numbers are considered to be one characters: e.g. – “A Better Offer” comes before “Again, Boys!”, and <NOBR>“8-Pound</NOBR> Cannon Volley” comes before <NOBR>“15-Pound</NOBR> Cannon Volley”. Numbers come before letters.</P>
<P class="p82 ft27"><NOBR><SPAN class="ft44">Boarding–</SPAN>A</NOBR> Boarding is begun by a player by paying their Ship Move Cost or playing an action, and continues until either both players pass their Boarding Attack or until a card effect ends the Boarding.</P>
<P class="p81 ft23"><NOBR><SPAN class="ft45">BoardingAttack–</SPAN>Any</NOBR> untacked Crew on a Ship that is in a Boarding may perform a Boarding Attack. The black Boarding Box on the card used to start the Boarding Attack is considered to be the actual attack (e.g. – “Slash” or “Dagger”). Boarding Attack cards are discarded after the Boarding Attack is resolved. You play Boarding Attacks from your hand. You perform a Boarding Attack when you push a Crew forward in a Boarding.</P>
<P class="p68 ft33"><SPAN class="ft42">Boarding Boxes – </SPAN>The three square symbols in the bottom left of a card. They are used to resolve Boarding Attacks. Boarding Boxes are always played as printed, regardless of the Most Recent Printing Rule.</P>
<P class="p38 ft5"><SPAN class="ft46">Cancel – </SPAN>Many actions may be canceled if the target pays the necessary cost to cancel it. Action cards with a copper flag can be canceled if the target pays the cancel cost in the copper flag.</P>
<P class="p36 ft33"><SPAN class="ft42">Card Types – </SPAN>There are seven types of cards in a deck: Action, Adventure, Attachment, Captain, Chantey, Crew, and Ship. Sea cards are never in a deck.</P>
<P class="p38 ft2"><SPAN class="ft43">Cost – </SPAN>What must be paid to perform an action or bring a cardintoplay.Typically,thisissimplytopaythecorrectnumber of skill points by tacking your Crew cards or using Reacts that produce skill points. Costs are found on a yellow flag.</P>
<P class="p38 ft33"><SPAN class="ft42">Control – </SPAN>These cards represent a pirate group’s firm control, through either charisma or terror, of one of Théah’s seas. If you are the only player at the end of the turn to Control each of the five Seas, you win the game.</P>
